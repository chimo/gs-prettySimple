pretty-simple
=============

A [GNU social](http://gnu.io/social/) Theme inspired by the [So Simple theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme).

It isn't finished yet, but you can see it in action [here](http://sn.chromic.org).

## Install

Make sure the files are in a folder if they're not already (ex: a folder called "pretty-simple")

Put the folder in your GNU social's '/local/theme' directory (create it if it doesn't exist)

Tell your GNU social instance to use the theme by adding the following to "/config.php":

```
$config['site']['theme'] = 'pretty-simple';
```
